# **Orbit Simulator**

## Background

This is a little 2D planetary obit simulator.

I originally programmed this in 2019. It's an adaptation of a C++/OpenGL script that I found online and translated into web technologies using HTML's "canvas" element. It's since been refactored slightly.

To run it, simply clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.
